# PoimandresDiscordBot
A  Discord Bot for quoting the Corpus Hermeticum

The purpose of this bot is to

A) Have an easy  method for referencing the freely available Hermetic Texts on Discord.

B) Learn some basic javascript/discord api programming.

As I am learning, I have commented more or less everything that needs explanation.

Keep in mind: Discord uses markdown text formatting. This is utilised in the bot's messages. eg.

`**this text is bold** `

`>>> this text is indented`

etc.

\books\ contains JSON files which bot.js pulls from.

Enjoy!
