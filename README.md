# PoimandresDiscordBot
A  Discord Bot for quoting the Corpus Hermeticum
Currently, the supported commands are limited to G.R.S Mead's CH and one translation of the Emerald Tablet.

 Try:
  `?lookup ch 1.2`
  or
  `?lookup emerald tablet`
  
  -
  
  `/books/` directory contains json-formatted copies of the Hermetic texts (filling this out is an on-going project)
  
  `bot.js` is where the bot goes online, listens for messages, responds to lookup requests, etc.
