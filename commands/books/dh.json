	"translator": "Jean-Pierre Mahe",
	"1.1": "God: an intelligible world;\nworld: a sensible God;\nman: a de-structible world;\nGod: an immovable world;\nheaven: a movable world;\nman: a reasonable world.\nThen there are three worlds.\nNow the immovable world (is) God, and the reasonable world is man: for both of (these) units (are) one: God and man after the species.",
	"1.2": "Consequently (there are) three worlds on the whole:\ntwo units (make up) the sensible and one (is) the intelligible; one (is) after the species, and the third one (is) after (its) fullness.\nAll of the multiple (belongs to) the three worlds; two of them (are) visible: (namely) the sensible and man, (that) destructible world; and the intelligible is this God: he is not visible, but evident within the visible (things).",
	"1.3": "Just as soul keeps up the figure (while being) within the body, which cannot possibly be constituted without a soul, likewise all of that visible cannot possibly be constituted without the invisible.",
	"1.4": "Now man is a small world because of soul and breath, and a perfect world whose magnitude does not exceed the sensible god, (i.e.) the world The world (is) intelligible and God (is) Nous; (he is) the truly uncreated the intelligible; by essence, the uncreated and the ineffable, the intelligiblegood In a word God is the intelligible world, the immovable Monad, the invisible world the intelligible, invisible and ineffablegood.",
	"1.5": "God is eternal and uncreated; man is mortal (although) he is ever-living.",
	"2.1": "Nous is the invisible good; soiil (is) a necessary movement adjusted to every (kind of) body.\nA body is (made out) of the four qualities, (as) a well-tempered composition of warm, cold, dry and wet: of warm (i.e.) of fire, of cold (i.e.) of air, of dry (i.e.) of earth, of wet (i,e.) of water.\nBreath is the body of soul or the column of soul.",
	"2.2": "Heaven is an eternal body, an immutable body, unalterable and mixed up out of soil and Nona Air is the separation of heaven firom the earth or the conjunction of heaven with earth.\nWhat is ail? They call â€˜air the interval between heaven and earth, by which they are not separated from each other, since heavens and earth are united (with each other) by the air.\na Barth is the support of the world, the basis of the elements, the nurse of the living (beings), the receptacle of the dead; for (it comes) last after fire and water, since it became what (it is) after fire and water.\nWhat is the power of the world? To keep up for ever the immortal (beings), such as they came into being, and to always change the mortal.",
	"2.4": "Water is a fecund essence, the support of earth,as a nutritive essence.",
	"2.5": "Fire is a sterile essence, the duration of the immortal bodies and the destruction of the mortal: an infertile substance, in as much (it belongs to) the destructive fire which makes (things) disappear; and the perpetuation of the immortal (beings), since what cannot be consumed by fire is immortal and indestructible, but the mortal can be destroyed by fire.",
	"2.6": "Light is a good, a clear vision, (which makes) appear all of the visible (things).\nThe essence of fire is burning.\nHowever, fire is one (thing) and light is another one.\nFor what fire has reached shall be destroyed, but light appears just as it is by itsdf.\nEvery move of soul is perceived by Nous; since it is some (kind of) energy, breath performs (it).",
	"3.1": "Nothing is uninhabited by God, for where heaven is, God (is) too, and where the world is, heaven (is) too.\nI think that (}od is in heaven, and heaven in the world.",
	"3.2": "Many (places) are iminhalnted by humans; for where the world is, the earth (is) too, but man is not on every earth.\nThe sea is large as well as the eeurth, but heaven by itself (is as much as) both the sea and the earth.\n[And he wanted to say that, by its magni- tude, heaven is (as much as) both the earth and the sea, so large as the two of them may be, since by taking everything into (itself), it encompassed it and it contains it enclosed within (itself).",
	"3.3": "Heaven is larger than everything, and the sun than earth and sea, for it extends beyond both of them.\nHowever the earth is larger than the sea, because the sea (comes) from it.\nAnd in heaven are all (the beings), for it contains the superior ones and it (also) contains the inferior, enclosing them from every side ",
	"3.4": "God is the good (which is) previous to all the intelligible (beings); God is the father of the intdligible; heaven is the maker of the body.The magnitude of the light of the sim is earth and sea; the mcgnitude of heaven (is) the world; the magnitude of the world is God.",
	"4.1": "The living (beings) in heaven are constituted of fire and air, and those (which are) on earth of the four elements.\nMan (is) a reasonable living (being), for he has Nous; but all of the other living (beings) which are endowed with voice have breath and soul, since aU that decreases and increases is a living (being).",
	"4.2": "And among the living (beings), some are immortal and ani- mated, some have Nous, soul and spirit, some (have) only spirit, some (have) soul and spirit, and others only life.\nFor life can acquire consistency without spirit.\nNous, soul and immortality, but all of the others without life cannot possibly exist.",
	"5.1": "(Reasonable) speech is the servant of Nous.\nFor what Nous wants, speech in turn interprets.\nNous sees everything, and eyes all corporeal (things).\nAnd yet Nous does not become an observer for the eyes, but the eyes for Nous.",
	"5.2": "To Nous nothing is incomprehensible, to speech nothing inef- fable: when you keep silent, you understand; when you talk, you (just) talk.\nSince Nous conceives speech in silence, only (that) speech (which comes) from silence and Nous (is) salvation.\n(But that) speech (which comes) from speech (is) only perdition; for by (his) body man is mortal, but by speech (he is) immortal.",
	"5.3": "Who does not understand speech has no Nous, who talks with- out Nous says nothing: since he understands nothing, he has no Nous and he talks, for his talk is a crowd and a crowd has neither Nous nor (reasonable) speech.\nSpeech endowed with Nous is a gift of (God; speech without Nous is a finding of man.\nNobody sees heaven and what (is) therein, but only man.\nOnly man has Nous and speech.",
	"6.1": "*Just as the gods are Gods possession, (so is) man too; and mans possession is the world; if there were nobody to see (it), what would be seen would not even exist.\nOnly man understands the intelligible (things) and sees the visible, for they are no aliens to him.\nMan has at once the two natures, the mortal and the immor- tal (one).'Manhas the three essences, (namely) the mtelligiHe, the animated and the material (one).*",
	"6.2": "*Just as you went out of the womb, likewise you will go out of this body; just as you will no longer enter the womb, likewise you will no longer enter this material body.\nJust as, while being in the womb, you did not know the (things which are) in the world, likewise when you are outside the body, you will not know the beings (thatcav) outside the body.\nJust as when you have gone out of the womb, you do not remember the (things which are) in the womb, likewise, whenyou have gone out of the body, you will be still more excellent.*",
	"6.3": "*The present (things) follow close upon the past, and the future (close upon) the present.\nJust as the body, once it has gained perfection in the womb, goes out of likewise the soul, once it has gained perfection, goes out of the body.\nFor just as a body, if it goes out of the womb (while it is still) imperfect can neither he fed nor grow up, likewise if soul goes out of the body without having gained perfection it is imperfect and lacks a body; but the perfection of soul is the knowledge of the beings, Just as you will behave towards your soul when (it is) in this body, likewise it will behave towards you when it has gone out of the body.* - Contain yourself, O Trismegistus ",
	"7.1": "But now, what is man? What (else) if neither body nor soul?\n-Aye, dear Asclepius, who (ever) is not soul, is neither Nous nor body.\nFor (one) thing is what becomes the body of man, and (another) thing what comes in addition to man.\nThen, what should be called truly a man, O' Asclepius, and what is man? The immortal species of every man.",
	"7.2": "And <the species> of every living (being) <is (only) in one part of the world,> hit the sole species of man (is) at once in heaven, on earth, in the water and in the air.\nJust as the body is marvellously moulded m the womb, likewise the soul in the body.",
	"7.3": "From the murk into light the body goes outofthe womb, but soul enters the body from the light into darkness? The sight of the body is the eye; but that of soul is Nous.\nJust as a body which has (got) no eyes sees nothing, likewise a soul which has (got) no Nous is blind.\nWhatever the (babe) in die womb will crave for, so will the pregnant woman desire the same; likewise whatever (Nous) in soul will crave for, so will man desire the same.",
	"7.4": "Soul enters the body by necessity, Nous (enters) soul by Judgement.\nWhile being outside tte body, soul (has) neither quality nor quantity;(once it is) in the body it receives, as an accident, <iuality and <iuantity as well asgoodandevil: for matter brings about such (things).",
	"7.5": "God is within himself, the world is in God, and man in the world.\nHis (ie.\nmans) deficiency is ignorance, his plenitude is the knowledge of God.\n**[He says that evil (consists) in ignorance and good in knowledge]**",
	"8.1": "All (beings) cannot possibly exceed their own capacity Nature is everyone of the beings of this (world); there is a law which is in heaven above destiny, and there is a destiny which has come into being according to a just necessity; there is a law which has come into being according to the necessity of hmnans, there is a god who has come into being according to human opinion.",
	"8.2": "Divine bodies do not have access paths for sensations, for they have sensations within themselves, and (what is more) they are themselves their own sensations.' What God does, man does not do it; and whatever God does, he does it for man; but what man does, he does it for soul",
	"8.3": "Those who worship idols (worship plain) pictures.\nFor if they worshipped with knowledge, they would not have gone astray, but since they do not know how they should worship, they have gone astray, (far) firom piety.' Man has the faculty of killing,' God of giving life,",
	"8.4": "The body increases and reaches perfections due to nature: and soul fills upwith Nous.sss Every manhasa bodyandasoul, but not every soul has Nous.Consequently there are two (types of) Nous: the one (is) divine' and the other (belongs to) soul.\nNevertheless there are certain men who do not have even that of souf.' Who(ever) understands the body, also understands soul; who(ever) tmderstands soul, also (understands) Nous, because the admirable is (a) natural (object) of contemplation: each of the two is seen by means of the other.",
	"8.5": "Nature is the mirror of truth; the latter is at once the body of the incorporeal (things)and the light of the invisible, The generous nature of this (world) teaches all (the beings).\nIf it seems to you that nothing is a vain work, you will find the work and the craftsman if it seems to you Gike) a mockery, you will be mocked",
	"8.6": "You have the power of getting ftee since you have been given eveiything.\nNobody envies you Everything came into being for you, so that by means of either one (being) or of the whole, you may understand the craftsman, For you have the power of not understanding with your (own) will; you have the power of lacking faith and being misled, so that you understand the contrary of the (reaD beings.\nMan has as much power as the goda Only man (is) a free living (being), only he has the power of good and evil",
	"8.7": "You do not have the power of becoming immortal ; neither does, indeed, the immortal (have the power) of dying.You can even become a god if you want, for it is possible.\nTherefore ward and understand and believe and love: then you have become (it)",
	"9.1": "Every man has a notion of God: for if he is a man, he also knows God, Every man, by the very (fact) that he has (got) a notion of God, is a man, for U is not (ven) to every man to have (such a) notion.\nMan and the gods andall things (exist) by God and because of man.\nGod is everything and there is nothing outside God, even that which does not exist: since as to God, there is no such thing, even one single <thai he is not himself> Man (comes) from another man, the gods (exist) because ofGod.Man (exists) because of God; everything because of man.\nGod rules over man; man over the whole.",
	"9.2": "The exterior (things) are understood by the external (organs): the eye sees the exterior (things), and Nous the interior.The exterior (things) would not exist, if there were not the interior (ones).\nWheriever) Nous (is), there is light; for Nous is light and light (is) Nous.\nWho(ever) tes Nous is enlightenedand who(ever) has not Nous is deprived of light.",
	"9.3": "Who(ever) knows God, does not fear God who(ever) does not know God fears God.\nWho(ever) knows none of the beings fears everyone; who(ever) knows all of them fears none.",
	"9.4": "Souls illness: sadness and souls passions: desire and opinion.\nBodies are similar to souls when they are seen: none (is) ugly (if it is) good, none is evil (if it is) honest.\nEverything is visible to one who has Nous; who(ever) thinks of himself in Nous knows himself and who(ever) knows himself knows every thing.\nEvery- thing is within man.",
	"9.5": "Who(ever) behaves well towards his body, behaves badly towards himselfJust as the body, without a soul, is a corpse, likewise soul, without Nous, is inert.\nOnce a soul has entered the body, it (soul) will acquire Nous.\nThat which does not acquire (it), goes out such as it had entered.\nFor every soul, before entering the body, is deprived of Nous; then Nous joins it from the body, so that eventually the soul becomes endowed with Nous.Â° That (soul) which has gone out of the human body has (got) an ill memory: for soul, (even) covered with the body, is forced to remember its (souls) unforgetfulness.\nOne change is unforgetful and (another) change brings about forgetfulness.",
	"9.6": "Wher(ever) man is, also (is) God.\nGod does not appear to anybody but man.\nBecause of man God changes and turns into the form of man.\nGod is man-loving and man is God-loving.\nThere is an affinity between God and man.\nGod listens only to man, and man to God.\nGod is worthy of worship, man is worthy of admiration.\nGod does not appear without man; man is desir- able to God and God to man, because desire comes from nowhere, but from man and God.",
	"9.7": "Humans work the land, (and) stars adorn heaven.\nThe gods have heaven; humans, <heaven>,earth and sea; but the air is common to gods and humans.",
	"10.1": "What is good? What bears no comparison.\nGood is invisible, (but) evil is conspicuous.What is a female? A receptive fluid- ity isi What is a male? A seminal fluidity.",
	"10.2": "Nature in man is omniform, and (it is) an energy endowed with all qualities (whose) force (is) invisible and effects (are) conspicuous.\nAn energy is a movement.\nMatter is a wet es- sence; a body is a agglomoration of matter.",
	"10.3": "Nous (is) in soul, and nature (is) in the body.\nNous (is) the maker of soul, and soul, (the maker) of the body.\nNous (is) not in all soul, but nature (is) in all body.",
	"10.4": "The immortal nature (is) the movement of the mortal nature, (as to) mortality, earth is its grave; (and) heaven (is) the place of the immortal.\nThe immortal came into being because of the mortal, but the mortal comes into being by means of the immor- tal.\nEvil is a deficiency of good, good (is) fiillness of itself.",
	"10.5": "Soul is bound to be born in this world, but Nous is superior to the world.\nJust as Nous is unbegotten, so is matter too, (al- though) it (can be) divided.\nNous is unbegotten, and matter (is) divisible; soul is threefold, and matter has three parts; genera- tion (is) in soul emd matter, (but) Nous (is) in God for the generation of the immortal (beings).",
	"10.6": "Providence and Necessity (are), in the mortal, birth and death, and in God, unbegotten (essence).\nThe immortal (beings) agree with one another and the mortal envy one another with jealousy, because evil envy arises due to knowing death in advance.\nThe immortal does what he always does, but the mortal does what he has never done.\nDeath, if understood, is immortal- ity; if not imderstood (it is) death.\nThey assume that the mortal (beings) of this (world) have fallen under (the dominion) of the immortal, but (in reality) the immortal are servants of the mortal of this (world).",
	"10.7": "Therefore soul is an immortal essence, eternal, intellective, having, as an intellectual (thought), its reason endowed with Nous.\nBy understanding nature, it attracts to itself the intellect of (the planetary) harmony,then, once it is freed from this natural body.\nit remains alone with itself (and) is grieved, belonging only to itself in the intelligible world.\nIt rules on its reason.]"
