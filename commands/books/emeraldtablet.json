"message": "*When I entered into the cave, I received the tablet zaradi, which was inscribed, from between the hands of Hermes, in which I discovered these words:*\n**1.** True, without falsehood, certain, most certain.\n**2.** What is above is like what is below, and what is below is like that which is above. To make the miracle of the one thing.\n**3.** And as all things were made from contemplation of one, so all things were born from one adaptation.\n**4.** Its father is the Sun, its mother is the Moon.\n**5.** The wind carried it in its womb, the earth breast fed it.\n**6.** It is the father of all â€˜works of wonder' (Telesmi) in the world.\n**6a.** Its power is complete (integra).\n**7.** If cast to (turned towards- versa fuerit) earth,\n**7a.** it will separate earth from fire, the subtile from the gross.\n**8.** With great capacity it ascends from earth to heaven. Again it descends to earth, and takes back the power of the above and the below.\n**9.** Thus you will receive the glory of the distinctive	ness of the world. All obscurity will flee from you.\n**10.** This is the whole most strong strength of all strength, for it overcomes all subtle things, and penetrates all solid things.\n**11a.** Thus was the world created.\n**12.** From this comes marvelous adaptions of which this is the proceedure.\n**13.** Therefore I am called Hermes, because I have three parts of the wisdom of the whole world.\n**14.** And complete is what I had to say about the work of the Sun, *from the book of Galieni Alfachimi*."
