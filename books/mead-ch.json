And I became transported as I gazed.\nBut in a little while Darkness came settling down on part [of it], awesome and gloomy, coiling in sinuous folds, so that methought it like unto a snake.\nAnd then the Darkness changed into some sort of a Moist Nature, tossed about beyond all power of words, belching out smoke as from a fire, and groaning forth a wailing sound that beggars all description.\n[And] after that an outcry inarticulate came forth from it, as though it were a Voice of Fire."

They fell in love with him, and gave him each a share of his own ordering.And after that he had well learned their essence and had become a sharer in their nature, he had a mind to break right through the Boundary of their spheres, and to subdue the might of that which pressed upon the Fire."

Nature thus brought forth frames to suit the form of Man.\nAnd Man from Light and Life changed into soul and mind - from Life to soul, from Light to mind.And thus continued all the sense-world's parts until the period of their end and new beginnings."

For all the animals being male-female, at the same time with Man were loosed apart; some became partly male, some in like fashion [partly] female. And straightway God spake by His Holy Word (Logos):Increase ye in increasing, and multiply in multitude, ye creatures and creations all; and man that hath Mind in him, let him learn to know that he himself is deathless, and that the cause of death is love, though Love is all."

Light and Life is Father-God, and from Him Man was born.If then thou learnest that thou art thyself of Life and Light, and that thou [happen'st] to be out of them, thou shalt return again to Life.

Nay, it is I, the Mind, that will not let the operations which befall the body, work to their [natural] end.
